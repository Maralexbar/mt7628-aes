# Mediatek AES Crypto Engine

New and improved AES Crypto Engine. Written from scratch to enable full features and performance
on Linux Kernel v4.6+. It features full asynchronous support with crypto-engine queue handling.

This AES Engine is (to my knowledge) only available in the Mediatek MT7628 and MT7688 SoC.
